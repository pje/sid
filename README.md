- [The original MOS specsheet for the 6581](http://archive.6502.org/datasheets/mos_6581_sid.pdf). Wonderful example of technical writing, but wrong in some specifics :(
- The original specsheet, [converted to text](http://www.sidmusic.org/sid/sidtech2.html)
- [The Insidious manual](https://impactsoundworks.com/docs/inSIDious%20Manual.pdf), which incidentally describes a lot of subtle stuff about the SID
